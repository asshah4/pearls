        Peripartum cardiomyopathy
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2018</span>

    <h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>During pregnancy, the body goes through significant hemodynamic changes. RAAS activation maintains blood pressure during the first trimester. Cardiac remodeling begins to occur to increase left-ventricular mass, along with enhanced angiogenesis. Delivery itself leads to a state of maximum cardiac output with increased catecholamines and auto transfusion of 300-500 mL of blood from the uterus into maternal circulation.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/hemodynamic-changes-pregnancy.png" alt="hemodynamic-changes-pregnancy.png" class="img-responsive" width="600px" /></p>

<p>This figure shows the concept that pregnancy leads to a period of dilation and hypertrophy that will be required to generate higher cardiac outputs to assist with delivery<a href="#Ruys2013"><span style="vertical-align: super">1</span></a>. This may lead to a period of vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>The working definition, most recently described by the European Society of Cardiology in 2010:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Idiopathic cardiomyopathy, diagnosis of exclusion</li>
  <li>Reduced ejection fraction &lt; 45% (ventricle does not need to be dilated)</li>
  <li>Presenting at the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-raises-suspicion">What raises suspicion?</h2>

<p>The classic phenotype to be at high risk for PPCM is an African descent, multiparty, pregnancy complications (preeclampsia, eclampsia, gestational hypertension), greater than 30 years of age, cocaine abuse, and beta agonist use (tocolytic therapy), and family history.</p>

<h3 id="genetic-etiology">Genetic etiology</h3>

<p>The incidence of this is quoted from 1:1000-4000 in the USA, with rising numbers. Its less frequent in Northern Europe and even less so in Asia. In Africa however there is a much higher risk, with 1:300 in Haiti, and up to 1:100 in a city in Nigeria (this particular area has a tradition of eating a ritual lake salt 40 days postpartum(missing reference). This suggests a cultural pattern versus an underlying genomic influence. In addition, family history increases risk of developing PPCM, suggesting a genetic etiology.</p>

<h3 id="inflammation-and-autoimmune-response">Inflammation and autoimmune response</h3>

<p>Myocarditis and higher levels of inflammatory markers have been found during acute PPCM. This has led to potential viral etiologies, but biopsies results have been varied in results in different populations.</p>

<h3 id="cardiac-demand-and-adrenergic-toxicity">Cardiac demand and adrenergic toxicity</h3>

<p>Risk factors that include cocaine, hypertension, like eclampsia, and beta agonism have all shown higher trends of PPCM.</p>

<h3 id="angiogenesis-and-oxidative-stress">Angiogenesis and oxidative stress</h3>

<p>Prolactin is cleaved by hormones of pregnancy (e.g. cathepsin D) into angiostatin and pro-apoptotic fragments. Acute PPCM shows increased oxidative stress and increased serum enzyme levels. Both apoptosis and angiogenesis failure seem to be indicated (at least in mouse models)</p>

<h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2>

<p>Theoretically, after 5 months postpartum there is a chance at recovery of ejection fraction. The markers that suggest lack of recovery include LVEF &lt; 30% and LVEDD &gt; 6 cm.</p>

<p>Standard heart failure management, after delivery, is the recommended course. Early beta-blockage, even at low dosages, may be protective even in those with severely depressed ejection fraction, along with ivabradine. However, in terms of treatment to help with actual recovery, novel studies suggest bromocriptine, with results showing ~90% with improvement, and ~50% with full recovery<a href="#Haghikia2013"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></a>.</p>

<h2 id="take-away-points">Take away points</h2>

<ol>
  <li>PPCM has rising incidence in the US</li>
  <li>Its an idiopathic cardiomyopathy with lV dysfunction at the end of pregnancy or months after pregnancy</li>
  <li>TTE is the mainstay for diagnosis, but cardiac MRI is being investigated</li>
  <li>Low selenium levels, viruses, inflammation, and hemodynamic stressors are important to developing PPCM</li>
  <li>Important biomarkers: N-terminal pro-BNP, prolactin, interferon gamma, ADMA, cathepsin D, microRNA-146a</li>
  <li>Treat like other heart failure guidelines, however bromocriptine can help in the acute setting in recovering function</li>
  <li>If they get pregnant again, there’s a high risk of worsening of cardiac function</li>

        Pathology and pathogenesis of alkalosis
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jun 2018</span>

    <h2 id="pathogenesis">Pathogenesis</h2>

<p>Alkalosis is the process of reduction of the [H+] in arterial blood plasma, which may result in an alkalemia ( pH &gt; 7.45). The entire process is initiated by either the loss of acid, or the retention or concentration of bicarbonate, and then there is a maintenance process of increased renal bicarbonate reabsorption.</p>

<h3 id="initiation">Initiation</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Process</th>
      <th>Examples</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Gain of bicarbonate</td>
      <td>increased metabolism of ketoacids, or administration of bicarbonate or its precursors (e.g. citrate, lactate, antacids, etc)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Loss of acid</td>
      <td>diuretics (causing sodium and hydrogen loss), through GI means (e.g. vomiting), increased H+ movement into the cells (e.g. during hypokalemia)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Reduction of intra-arterial blood volume</li>
  <li>Hypochloremia</li>
  <li>Hypokalemia</li>
  <li>Increased sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules (ENaC favors excretion of hydrogen and potassium in exchange)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</h2>

<p>Mortality is increased with alkalemia, with a pH &gt; 7.55 having up to 45% risk for mortality, and pH &gt; 7.65 having up to an 80% risk for mortality.<a href="#Anderson1987"><span style="vertical-align: super">1</span></a> Metabolic alkalosis is also the most common acid-base disturbance in the ICU.<a href="#Mæhle2014"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></a>  <em>Interestingly, in 2017 there was a study on alkalemia in sepsis/septic shock, and although length of stay was extended, 30 day and 12 month mortality was not increased.</em><a href="#Jazrawi2017"><span style="vertical-align: super">3</span></a></p>

<h3 id="respiratory">Respiratory</h3>

<p>Compensatory hypoventilation is mediated through central chemoreceptors, however in the periphery there is also decrease O2 delivery by: (1) the Bohr effect and the shifting of the oxygen dissociation curve of hemoglobin, (2) vasoconstrictor effect with subsequent decreased perfusion of the brain, heart, and peripheral circulation (which thus reduces O2 deliver). The blood flow and cardiovascular impact is partially mediated by vascular smooth muscle tone, which increases with elevated pH (regardless of it being respiratory or metabolic alkalosis), which subsequently has downstream effects on the heart and brain.</p>

<h3 id="cardiovascular">Cardiovascular</h3>

<p>In coronary disease, patients will have decreased myocardial oxygen delivery with hyperventilation (an induction of respiratory alkalosis), along with decreased coronary blood flow, and increased coronary vascular resistance. When exercised or stressed, the coronary arteries will also have an attenuated vasodilatory response. However, the use of bicarbonate in code situations to reverse is complex, as the acid production due to hypoperfusion cannot be corrected (normally through [H+] and [HCO3-] combining to form H2 and CO2 to be exhaled) unless adequate perfusion and ventilation are initiated, as it can temporarily lead to an increased PaCo2 level which in turn leads to decreased cardiac contractility and fibrillatory thresholds.</p>

<h3 id="neurologic">Neurologic</h3>

<p>The initial bicarbonate infusion (such as during codes) leads to rapid Co2 rises and lowered pH, particularly in the cereberal circulation (coined “paradoxic cerebral acidosis”), which in turn leads to local vasodilation. However, in non-code situations, such as in ischemic stroke, the effects are different. Systemic alkalosis worsens electrophysiological recovery after cerebral ischemia (actually mediated through an NMDA-receptor meganism), regardless of pH, due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.  Other mechanisms include increased serum pH increases un-ionized nitrogen compound production (such as NH3) leading to CNS penetration which can worsen encephalopathy. The tetany and parasthesias accompanying alkalosis however are more directly mediated from cation depletion as part of the renal response.</p>
