## Setup

This site is developed through Jekyll and uses the Hyde theme. It uses the **jgd** gem for creating a new **gh-pages** branch to publish the site, as Github pages fails to build with external plugins.

## Development

*Ultrasound Reckoning* has two branches.

- `master` for development, including literature review and image processing
- `gh-pages` for the hosted site, built in real time using the *jgd* gem
