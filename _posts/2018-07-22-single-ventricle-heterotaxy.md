## Congenital heart anatomy

Without having ever seen the heart of a congenital patient, its difficult for me to imagine how their hemodynamics are affected. I looked at a patient a complex congenital heart that had undergone several revisions.

- single ventricle heterotaxy with left isomerism
- interrupted IVC with hemiazygous continuation
- single ventricle and single ventricle
- Kawashima palliation
- bidirectional, bilateral Glenn shunts
- closure of the pulmonic valve
- mechanical atrioventricular valve
