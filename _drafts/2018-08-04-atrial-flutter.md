## The pathways of atrial flutter

Atrial flutter has two classifications based on termination/rate, and by directionality.  Type I atrial flutter terminates with rapid atrial pacing (RAP) and has an atrial rate from 240 — 340 BPM; Type II atrial flutter doesn’t terminate with RAP and has an atrial rate of 340 — 440 BPM. 

The directionality though is based on anatomy.
